He was punctual in picking us up at the hostel and made us feel safe at all times, very attentive to the group throughout the tour. He told us interesting stories along the way and set the mood for the road trip with Andean music to liven up the experience even more. We were able to observe and identify various fauna and he took the time to take pictures of us in wonderful places. I also highlight the food service, since the vegetarian options were varied and very complete. It was a long but wonderful day! Many thanks to Kai and Chile tours for the quality of their service. 100/10 totally recommended!",

At the beginning of the 15th century, the Inca ruler Túpac Yupanqui conquered the Atacameños' territories, reorganizing them socially and politically, imposing, at the same time, a new religion - the cult of the sun - and changing some rites such as, for example, the ceremonial consumption of hallucinogenic substances for that of coca leaves.",
          "description-1": "The sections of the Inca road network that connected the Atacama salt flat with the highlands and the current Argentine northwest correspond to this period. The arrival of the Spanish conquerors to the Atacameños oasis around 1536 was resisted during the first decades by the indigenous population and only in 1556 the area was definitively pacified through the peace treaty of Suipacha. At the end of the 16th century, the colonial period began in the area with its subsequent grants of land, encomiendas and evangelization, reaching the town of San Pedro to reach macro-regional geopolitical relevance. During the 17th century, the Atacameños suffered strong cultural and technological changes, such as the introduction of mule cattle, and a progressive depopulation of the area also began. In the 18th century, in the face of the crisis and transformations that the Andean indigenous world was experiencing, the messianic uprisings of Túpac Amaru and Tomás Catari germinated, extending to Atacama under the leadership of Tomás Paniri, a native of the area.",
          "description-2": "After becoming independent from Spain in 1824, ending the colonial period, Atacama became part of the Republic of Bolivia, developing greatly thanks to an active mercantilism in which it was involved. At the end of the War of the Pacific in 1883, the region was annexed to Chile. Under Chilean rule, the region's economy was first focused on saltpeter exploitation and later on copper, leading to migration, the proletarianization of the indigenous population and the usurpation of the territory's water resources for industrial needs. Currently, 21,015 people identify themselves as Atacameños or Licanantai, representing 3.04% of the Chilean indigenous population.",

The region was incorporated into the Spanish Empire, and the Atacameños, like many other indigenous peoples, were subjected to a system of domination that profoundly altered their way of life.",
          "description-1": "The process of conquest was long and often violent, with numerous battles between the Spanish and the indigenous communities. However, the Atacameños were eventually subjugated and forced to accept Spanish authority. The imposition of the Catholic religion was one of the most powerful tools of control. Missionaries came to the region to evangelize the indigenous people, building churches and establishing parishes in the main settlements.",
          "description-2": "Churches built during the colonial era, such as the Church of San Pedro de Atacama, are examples of religious architecture that combines European influences with local elements. These structures, made of adobe and roofed with cactus wood, are a symbol of the fusion of cultures that occurred during colonization. Although Catholicism was imposed, many aspects of the indigenous worldview survived, being syncretically integrated into religious practices.",
          "description-3": "During the colonial period, the Atacameños were subjected to the encomienda system, in which they were forced to work for Spanish encomenderos in exchange for protection and Christian teaching. This system, although theoretically intended to protect the indigenous people, resulted in the exploitation and decline of the indigenous population due to the harsh working conditions and diseases brought by the Europeans.",

These mummies, many of which are in an exceptional state of preservation thanks to the dry desert climate, offer a unique insight into the funerary customs and daily life of the ancient inhabitants. The mummies were buried with offerings, including food, tools, and ceramic objects, suggesting beliefs in an afterlife.",

This museum houses a vast collection of artifacts, including textiles, tools, and ceramics, that showcase the artistic and technical skill of the Atacameños. In addition, the museum conducts ongoing research and archaeological excavations in the region, which has allowed for a greater understanding of pre-Hispanic cultures.",

          "description-2": "However, the rapid growth in tourism has also had negative effects. The influx of tourists has put pressure on the region's water resources, which are already scarce due to the extremely dry climate. In addition, increased traffic and construction has affected the integrity of the landscape and put archaeological and cultural sites at risk. In response, local authorities and indigenous communities have implemented measures to control the impact of tourism, promoting sustainable practices and educating visitors about the importance of preserving the environment.",

If possible, spend a couple of days in San Pedro de Atacama before embarking on higher altitude excursions. This will allow your body to slowly adjust to the environmental conditions. During these first few days, avoid strenuous physical activities and get plenty of rest. Listen to your body and allow it to adjust before exploring the highest points",

At high altitudes, the body loses fluids more quickly, which can exacerbate the symptoms of altitude sickness. Drink water frequently, even if you do not feel thirsty, and avoid excessive alcohol or caffeine consumption, as these substances can dehydrate you and worsen symptoms",

These products are widely available in San Pedro de Atacama and can be safely consumed to help mitigate mild symptoms of soroch",
          "description-3": "If you plan to visit high altitude places such as the Tatio Geyser or the altiplanic lagoons, consider consulting with a doctor before your trip, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or if this is your first time traveling to high altitudes. Doctors can prescribe medications such as acetazolamide, which helps prevent and treat altitude sickness. This medication must be taken before beginning the ascent and during the days of stay at altitude to be effective.",
